- The motivation for the project:
+ In this project, I will use the Seattle Airbnb Dataset suggest by Udacity for this project.
+ This project focuses on answering following questions:
Question1: What are the most common amenities that are available in Seattle Airbnb dataset?
Question2: I would like to know about some features which have property_type amenities columns?
Question3: My last question is: I would like to know how about the amenities and propotion of thems?

+ By being a part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, WA. The orijinal dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle.

- The libraries that I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn
Seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
Collections
Math

Question1:
- Analyse: Create the chart of top 20 most common amenities
- Visualise: ![Q1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68496531/204135969-9b1f3aec-9cd8-430a-a991-daa97691c45d.PNG)
- Explain the visualisation: Internet has the highest propotion, Elevator in Buiding has the lowest propotion
Question2:
- Analyse: Create the chart of top 20 most common amenities
- Visualise: ![Q1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68496531/204135969-9b1f3aec-9cd8-430a-a991-daa97691c45d.PNG)
- Explain the visualisation: Entire home/apt has the highest reserve propotion, while shared room has the lowest reverve propotion
Question3:
- Analyse: Create the chart of amenity type and the reserve propotion of thems
- Visualise: ![Q3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68496531/204136028-98aacb13-c620-4e3e-9fdb-4ee88bc650d5.PNG)
- Explain the visualisation: Washer/ Dryer has the highest reserve propotion with amenity, without amenity and reserve deviant also, Smoke Detector has the lowest reserve propotion in all 3 types.

- Descriptions for my 2 files:
+ The DataScientist-BlogPost-ChuBachKhoa Jupyter notebook is use for analyze, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations
+ The listings.csv suggest by Udacity is in csv format
